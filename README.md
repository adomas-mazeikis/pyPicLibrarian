# pyPicLibrarian
An application for making archiving of pics easier

### Goal
When one uses such online storage services as Amazon Drive, Dropbox etc. a problem arises that those cannot figure out duplicates or same name file handling. Moreover, digital cameras do name files in sequences instead of adding some timestamp into filename. So, all in all one ends up having multiple directories with files: Photo-1.jpg in all of those and these are different photos. Whenever these photos are to be moved into one directory - it becomes an issue.
So, I decided to write a small Python script first, but eventually plan to develop a full pledged GUI application for handling such cases properly, like dupe finding, advanced renaming (add "-1" before extension for example) etc.
